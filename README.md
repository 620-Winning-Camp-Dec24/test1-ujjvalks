# Fertilizer Impact Prediction

A predictive model that analyzes and forecasts the impact of different fertilizers on crop growth. This project leverages data analytics and AI techniques to suggest optimal fertilizer combinations for improving crop yields while maximizing cost efficiency.

## Features
- **Predictive Analysis**: Forecasts the effects of various fertilizers on crop growth.
- **Yield Improvement**: Recommends optimal fertilizer combinations for increased yield.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Identifies the most cost-effective fertilizer strategies to maximize crop output per unit.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provides actionable insights using historical crop and fertilizer data.

## Technologies Used
- **AI/ML**: Machine Learning models for predictive analysis.
- **Data Analytics**: Data-driven approach for analyzing fertilizer impacts.
- **Cloud Storage**: Utilized for storing large datasets and model outputs.
- **PC**: Local system used for model development and testing.
  
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Software**:
  - Python 3.x (for running the predictive models).
  - Required Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib).
  - Cloud Storage access (e.g., Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3) for storing datasets.
