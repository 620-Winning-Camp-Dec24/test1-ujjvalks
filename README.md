# Fertilizer Impact Prediction System

This project aims to predict the amount of fertilizer required for a specific crop, using machine learning to forecast the impact of various fertilizers on crop growth. It helps in recommending optimal fertilizer combinations for improving crop yields and maximizing cost efficiency.

## Features
- **Predictive Analysis**: Forecasts the effects of different fertilizers on crop growth.
- **Yield Improvement**: Suggests optimal fertilizer combinations to increase crop yield.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Maximizes crop output per unit of fertilizer to reduce costs.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provides actionable insights by analyzing historical crop and fertilizer data.

## Project Structure
- **Data Collection**: Utilizes a dataset that includes crop details and corresponding fertilizer requirements.
- **Model Training**: A machine learning model is trained to learn the relationship between crop characteristics and fertilizer needs.
- **Prediction**: The model predicts the amount of fertilizer needed for a specific crop based on its features.
- **User Interface**: A simple user interface for users to input crop data and receive fertilizer predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **AI/ML**: Uses machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- **Data Analytics**: Data-driven approach to analyze fertilizer impacts.
- **Cloud Storage**: For storing large datasets and model outputs.
- **PC**: Local system used for development and testing.
