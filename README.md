Fertilizer Prediction System
This project is a Fertilizer Prediction System which aims to predict the amount of fertilizer required for a specific crop. The project is built using Python and includes a machine learning model for predicting fertilizer needs.

Features

Data Collection: The project utilizes a dataset containing information about various crops and their corresponding fertilizer requirements.
Model Training: A machine learning model is trained on the collected data to learn the relationships between crop characteristics and fertilizer needs.
Prediction: The trained model can predict the amount of fertilizer required for a new crop, based on its input features.
User Interface: A user interface is provided for users to input crop information and receive fertilizer predictions.
Project Structure

data: Contains the data used for training and prediction.
fertilizer_model.pkl: Stores the trained machine learning model.
gui.py: Defines the graphical user interface for the system.
main.py: Runs the main program logic.
model_prediction.py: Contains the code for predicting fertilizer needs.
